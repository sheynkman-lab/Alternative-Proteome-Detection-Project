## Mass Spectrometry Analysis

### Data Availability

Raw data files, Proteome Discoverer PSM files, Tomahto Results files must be downloaded from the [PRIDE archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive) using accessions PXD050904 and PXD050909. <br />

Skyline reports for shTMTpro and TMTpro labeled peptides must be generated from the .raw files based on the settings described in the Methods section of the manuscript [IS-PRM-based peptide targeting informed by long-read sequencing for alternative proteome detection](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.01.587549). <br />

File paths in the *Read in Files* section will need to be changed accordingly.
