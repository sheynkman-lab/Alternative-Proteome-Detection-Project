### This is where all of the tracks for The [UCSC Genome Browser Track session](https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/emilyfwatts/Alternative%2DProteome%2DDetection) are held.
The folder `scripts` contains all of the scripts used to create these files. More information about the workflow of this process can be found [here](https://github.com/efwatts/PoGo2GenomeBrowser/tree/main).
